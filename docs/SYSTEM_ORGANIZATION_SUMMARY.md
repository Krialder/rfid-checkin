   - Reason: Simple interactions, easier maintenance than separate JS
   - Status: ✅ Acceptable - Industry standard for simple interactions

### Minor Cleanup Remaining:
- ✅ All major inline CSS has been moved to dedicated files
- ✅ Test files now use external CSS (test-pages.css)
- ✅ Admin tools now use dedicated CSS (admin-tools.css)  
- ✅ Frontend pages now use dedicated CSS files
